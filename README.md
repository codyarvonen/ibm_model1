# ibm_model1

The `ibm_model1.py` script is my version of the IBM Model 1 word alignment algorithm. To view the output for the English to French sentance pairs with the probability matrix after each iteration, refer to the `small.txt` file. To view the output for the English to Spanish dataset that I created with 50 sentance pairs for extra credit, refer to the `large.txt` file. Also, to double check that my output of the algorithm with the English to French dataset is correct, refer to the `ibm_model1_visualization.png` file.

To run this script, simply comment out the dataset you would like to use and run `python3 ibm_model1.py` in the command line.
